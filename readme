What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the

unauthorized sources of information.

None.

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I enjoyed working on this assignment! It gave me a decent introduction to
pointers, arrays, and strings in C. It was also helpful to learn how to use
the man page to build custom functions. The instructions given are very clear 
too.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, it is not possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough because the functions do not specify the size of the destination 
memory area. Besides that, Str_getLength returns the number of characters 
in the string excluding the null byte, so there is no way for us the know 
the actual size of the destination memory area.
